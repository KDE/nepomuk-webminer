In here you'll find the browser plug-ins for the meta-data extractor

While the LPart plugin for konqueror is build together with the main cmake setup, the NPAPI part will not be build.

For the Chrome/Firefox etc plugins, you need to compile the NPAPI plugin first

To to this you need firebreath.
@see http://www.firebreath.org/
@see http://colonelpanic.net/2010/11/firebreath-tips-working-with-source-control/

git clone git://github.com/firebreath/FireBreath.git firebreath-dev
git submodule update --recursive --init

Than copy the NPAPI folder into the projects folder and run

bash ./prepmake.sh
make

Now copy the created "npMetaDataFetcherPlugin.so" into the chrome folder.

To get this into chrome
* open it
* select Tools->Extensions from the menu
* Enable the Developer mode
* Load the unpacked Plugin
* select the "chrome folder with the npMetaDataFetcherPlugin.so" file

Everything is working now.

The metadatafetcher has to be installed for this.
The library to compile the NPAPI program and the commandline program to get the fetching and saving to work
