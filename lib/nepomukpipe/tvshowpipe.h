          * @brief Pipes a QVariantMap with Tv Shows information into Nempomuk
          *
          * The QVariantMap with the information contains several other QVariantMaps.
          * For the purpose of single episodes this seem overly complicated, but this helps to simply
          * bulk import complete seasons or even series in one go without quering the web resource all
          * over again.
          *
          * This takes care of the special case that tv shows always come in large series that are all connected
          * to each other.
          *
          * The QVariantMap should have this keys:
          *
          * @li @c title
          * @li @c overview
          * @li @c imdbid
          * @li @c banner
          * @li @c seasons - QVariantList containing more QVariantMaps with series info
          *
          * The QVariantmap containing the season information looks like this:
          *
          * @li @c number
          * @li @c banner
          * @li @c episodes - QVariantList containing more QVariantMaps with episodes info
          *
          * The QVariantmap containing the episode information looks like this:
          * @li @c resourceuri - the file url or nepomuk uri of the resource this data should be added to
          * @li @c title
          * @li @c overview
          * @li @c number
          * @li @c firstaired - Dateformat for QDateTime TODO what format should be used here? yyyy-mm-dd?
          * @li @c genres - split by ;
          * @li @c director - split by ;
          * @li @c writer - split by ;
          * @li @c actors - split by ;
          *
          * @todo support bulk import of a complete series with all its episodes
