  * @brief Pipes a QVariantMap with Tv Shows information into Nempomuk
  *
  * The QVariantMap with the information contains several other QVariantMaps.
  * For the purpose of single episodes this seem overly complicated, but this helps to simply
  * bulk import complete seasons or even series in one go without quering the web resource all
  * over again.
  *
  * This takes care of the special case that tv shows always come in large series that are all connected
  * to each other.
  *
  * The QVariantMap should have this keys:
  *
  * @li @c title
  * @li @c overview
  * @li @c imdbid
  * @li @c banner
  * @li @c poster
  * @li @c seasons - QVariantList containing more QVariantMaps with series info
  *
  * The QVariantmap containing the season information looks like this:
  *
  * @li @c number
  * @li @c banner
  * @li @c poster
  * @li @c episodes - QVariantList containing more QVariantMaps with episodes info
  *
  * The QVariantmap containing the episode information looks like this:
  * @li @c resourceuri - the file url or nepomuk uri of the resource this data should be added to
  * @li @c title
  * @li @c overview
  * @li @c number
  * @li @c banner
  * @li @c poster
  * @li @c firstaired - use yyyy or yyy-mm-dd
  * @li @c genres - split by ;
  * @li @c director - split by ;
  * @li @c writer - split by ;
  * @li @c actors - split by ;
