  * @brief The resource extractor is used to retrieve some basic information from files and resources
  *
  * Here we check the file or the Nepomuk resource and extract values from it that can be used for the @c WebExtractor search.
  * Usually it would be enough to check only Nepomuk for this info and when some files are given as input the right nepomuk
  * resource can be looked up and used for the retrival. As the @c libstreamanalyzer might fail on several pdf files this class
  * uses its own pdf parsing to get the right details. Also the filename will be analyzed to get some additional information
  *
  * Each file/resource is represented by its @c MetaDataParameters that is used for the actual search
  *
  * This Extractor keeps a list of all files that must be processed.
  * You can get the list via resourcesList() and pop the next entry from takeNext()
