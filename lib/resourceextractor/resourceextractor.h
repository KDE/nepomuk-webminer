  * @brief The resource extarctor is used to retrieve some basic information from files and resources
  *
  * Here we check the file or the Nepomuk resource and extract values from it that can be used for the @c WebExtractor search.
  * Usually it would be enough to check only Nepomuk for this info and when some files are given as input the right nepomuk
  * resource can be looked up and used for the retrival. As the libstreamanalyzer might fail on several pdf files this class
  * uses its own pdf parsing to get the right details.
  *
  * The out put of this class is a ordered Hash where all files are sorted by category:
  * @li publication
  * @li tvshow
  * @li movie
  * Where each file/resource is represented by its MetaDataParameters that is used for the actaul search
