/**
  * @brief Pipes a @c QVariantMap with <i>TV Shows</i> information into @c Nempomuk
  *
  * The QVariantMap with the information contains several other QVariantMaps.
  * For the purpose of single episodes this seem overly complicated, but this helps to simply
  * bulk import complete seasons or even series in one go without quering the web resource all
  * over again.
  *
  * This takes care of the special case that tv shows always come in large series that are all connected
  * to each other.
  *
  * This Pipe class generates the correct Nepomuk structure, splits person names and add them as subresource,
  * defines the subresource relationship between Show/Series/Episode and downloads the posters/banners from
  * the internet to a user defined folder.
  *
  * The QVariantMap should have this keys:
  *
  * @li @c title - the name of the show
  * @li @c overview - longer description about the show
  * @li @c imdbid - optional imdb id
  * @li @c banner - url of the banner location
  * @li @c poster - url of the poster location
  * @li @c seasons - QVariantList containing more QVariantMaps with the @c season info
  *
  * The QVariantMap containing the season information looks like this:
  *
  * @li @c number - the season number
  * @li @c banner - url of the banner location
  * @li @c poster - url of the poster location
  * @li @c episodes - QVariantList containing more QVariantMaps with @c episodes info
  *
  * The QVariantmap containing the episode information looks like this:
  * @li @c resourceuri - the file url or nepomuk uri of the resource this data should be added to
  * @li @c title - the title of this episode
  * @li @c overview - longer description of the episode
  * @li @c number - the episode number
  * @li @c banner - url of the banner location
  * @li @c poster - url of the poster location
  * @li @c firstaired - use yyyy or yyy-mm-dd
  * @li @c genres - split by ;
  * @li @c director - split by ;
  * @li @c writer - split by ;
  * @li @c actors - split by ;
  * @li @c seealso - url where we got the metadata from
  *
  *
 * The @c poster and @c banner won't be downloaded and added if it disabeld in the metadata KConfig.
 * The location of the @c poster or @c banner can be configured as well, either next to the video file or in the data fodler of the library
